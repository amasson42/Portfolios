## Me talking about me

Hi, my name is Arthur Masson and I'm passionate about creating random automatized things.
I've always loved mathematics, smart thinking and reliable logic and I also thing those three things are kind of the same thing !
I have started to love programming since the first time I created a custom map in warcraft3 and never really stop learning new things since then.
Aside of that I spend lot of my time playing video games...
So much that if I had not spent this potentially productive time playing and instead creating my own game then I could probably have made ~~a game~~ the best game of all time that could have wasted the social life of an entire generation instead of just mine ! I'm glad I'm not that kind of monster in the end O:)
