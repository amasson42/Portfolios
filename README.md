## Me talking about me

Hi, my name is **Arthur Masson** and I'm passionate about creating random automatized things.
I've always loved mathematics, smart thinking and reliable logic but we all know those three things are kind of the same thing !

I have started to love programming since the first time I created a custom map in warcraft3 and never really stopped learning new things since then.

Aside of that I spend lot of my time playing video games...
So much that if I had not spent this *potentially* productive time playing but instead creating my own game then I would have made ~~a game~~ the best game of all time that would have wasted the social life of an entire generation instead of just mine ! I'm glad I'm not that kind of monster and I contain myself of doing so by playing more games O:)

I've started programming in C and I've always liked it until I discovered that other languages existed as well... Oh my god, such a life changing even the day I found out about C++ !
That thing I was doing with my uniformalized structures and function and those code template I had to copy and paste for each one of my different types was already a thing ! It was called POO... Awesome !... I'm less ignorant now !

Therefore, C++ stayed my favorite language for a long time. The main reason was because I have gotten really familiar with its syntax but also because it was the best langage to create video games ! (wich was and still is one of my ambitions)

I've then wanted to create graphical programs (because for some unknown reason, playing pacman on command-line was getting boring) so as an eternal Mac user, I had to leave my new favorite langage for another one to use all of those amazing graphical frameworks designed by Apple : The language Objective-C (ever heard about that ?) I never really liked it but had to use it so I did.

Then one day Apple created his own new and modern language called **Swift**...
Wow ! My life had a new purpose since ! Two weeks of using Swift made me fall in love with this perfectly designed language !
I'm not an addict of mobile plateform... As a matter of fact, I hate playing on those... But games aren't the only thing we do on our phones (I guess).
So for the only reason that I love the Apple ecosystem, I've spend lot of time creating apps for iPhone and Mac !

I really like working in a group, not only for the social interactions, but also because when I'm alone on a project, I tend to let it drown after a day of not working on it or just with the random idea of another useless project
